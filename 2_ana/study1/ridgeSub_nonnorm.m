function [D,B,lspace,kfold,ncv] = ridgeSub_nonnorm(y,X,lam)
% runs ridge glm for a specific session/subject 
%
% Input:    - y
%           - X: Design matrix
%           - lam: if a lambda is specified, then deviance (D)  and beta (B) output will be specified for this lambda, otherwise output is over all lambdas
%           
% OUTPUT:   - D: deviance matrix as 1 x nLambda, unless lam-input is specified, then output is single deviance value for this lambda
%           - B: nB x nLambda matrix, unless lam-input is specified, then output is nB x 1 for this lambda  
%           - lspace: lambda space (set to lam if lam is defined)
%           - kfold: how many folds were used for crossvalidation (output this only for information)
%           - ncv: number of crossvalidation runs
